### Introduction to the GitHub Repository

This repository includes course materials and my final project for the course. The `CSEcon` and `Advance_CSEcon` folders contain my solutions to problem sets 1 and 2, which reflect and summarize a week's learning. The remaining folders hold materials for the final project titled 'Assessing the Semantic Capabilities of Large Language Models in Collaborative AI Settings.'

- **Self-Introduction**:
  -My interests lie in the application of machine learning methods to economics and finance. I have experience with large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which I leverage to enhance and innovate within these fields.
- **Final Reflections**: 
  - **Intellectual Growth**:
  - Over the four-weeks we explored the intersection of these two fields, starting with the fundamental research questions and methodologies that define this interdisciplinary area. We delved into microeconomic models and computational methods, focusing on the "technique pipeline" essential for innovation in computational economics. The course then covered the application of game theory and mechanism design, where we used tools like Nashpy, QuantEcon, Game Theory Explorer, and Gambit to formalize and simulate economic strategies. A significant aspect of the course was the emphasis on collaborative learning and peer feedback, which enriched our understanding and fostered a supportive educational environment.
  
  - **Professional Growth**:
  - The enhancement of computational skills, gaining a deep understanding of economic modeling, game theory, and the integration of algorithmic strategies. Other skills regarding the usage of platforms and tools such as github, oTree, Overleaf and other graph generating websites has also proven to be useful in our future academic lives.My career aspirations are now focused on leveraging these competencies in a role that blends economic theory with practical technology applications. I aim to work in environments where I can contribute to data-driven policy making or strategic business decisions, ideally growing into a position that allows me to lead projects and initiatives at the intersection of technology and economics. This course has not only refined my technical skills but also enhanced my collaborative and critical thinking abilities, preparing me for advanced challenges in a dynamic professional landscape.
  - **Living a Purposeful Life**:
  - Moving forward, my goals include deepening this impact by tackling real-world economic challenges through advanced technology. I aspire to lead research initiatives aimed at solving economic disparities and enhancing decision-making in both public and private sectors. Continuously adapting to emerging technologies and methods, I am committed to a purposeful life that advances my career and contributes meaningfully to societal well-being.
